Badly photographed, acted, and directed. Every single scene is underlighted, including those very few that are shot during the daytime. It doesn't matter what the location is. At an important conference in the White House, no lights are on, and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows. The primier of China conducts an earth-shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting. Honest. It's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness. The slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any ill-thought-out movie.<br /><br />Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo do well by their roles, but Scheider is rarely on screen. The other performances are dismissable. There is a pretty Oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a Bond movie who's accent suggests a childhood spent in Basset, Nebraska, and who should have remained the model she probably started out as. Whoever plays the surviving Secret Service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like Johnny Depp, not because of any display of talent. The Chinese villains, representing both Taiwan and mainland China, hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes. <br /><br />The script is pretty awful, recycled from other, better films. There is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up mincemeat. Two thirds of the way through, the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs. Then the movie splits into two related parts. Part one, another shootout, this time in a waterfront warehouse. Part two, an exchange between the Vice President, now acting president, and the oily Chinese premiere, lifted out of both \\\"Dr. Strangelove\\\" and \\\"Fail Safe.\\\" We unwittingly launch our missiles. They launch theirs in retaliation. We cannot convince them that our launch was accidental, even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. There is even the George C. Scott/ Walter Matthau general who argues that their \\\"nucular\\\" armory can't match ours so we should hit them with everything we've got. More fireballs. <br /><br />The end comes none too soon.\",\n          \"In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. Human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek, winner of several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human cost of war is made quite clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed in Southern India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of Sri Lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by P.S. Keerthana in a memorable performance, Amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (J.D. Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a Red Cross camp. In a loving flashback, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, father Thiru (Madhavan) a prominent Tamil writer, and mother Indra (Simran) a TV personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.<br /><br />Young Amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. While she is playing, Thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that \\\"you are not our daughter\\\" and the response is predictable. Distraught, she questions who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the Tamil separatists. The family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mostly with skill by Ratnam, though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.<br /><br />A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however, I found the musical dramatizations of songs by A. R. Rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich\\u00e9d and commercial, yet A Peck on the Cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. That it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.\",\n          \"FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway). Though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution. The story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in America.<br /><br />The stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the U.S. and Europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it. Luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway).<br /><br />This is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget. And it just might change the way you see the world...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\",\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

that are shot during the daytime. it doesn't matter what the location is. at an important conference in the white house, no lights are on, and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows. the primier of china conducts an earth-shattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of homer in a rembrandt painting. honest. it's as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness. the slow motion deaths are by now obligatory in any ill-thought-out movie.<br /><br />roy scheider and maria conchita alonzo do well by their roles, but scheider is rarely on screen. the other performances are dismissable. there is a pretty oriental woman in a short tight skirt who totes a gun and is right out of a bond movie who's accent suggests a childhood spent in basset, nebraska, and who should have remained the model she probably started out as. whoever plays the surviving secret service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably picked for the part because he looked most like johnny depp, not because of any display of talent. the chinese villains, representing both taiwan and mainland china, hiss and grin as they threaten the heroes. <br /><br />the script is pretty awful, recycled from other, better films. there is a lot of shooting aboard the ship and practically everyone winds up mincemeat. two thirds of the way through, the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs. then the movie splits into two related parts. part one, another shootout, this time in a waterfront warehouse. part two, an exchange between the vice president, now acting president, and the oily chinese premiere, lifted out of both \\\"dr. strangelove\\\" and \\\"fail safe.\\\" we unwittingly launch our missiles. they launch theirs in retaliation. we cannot convince them that our launch was accidental, even though we offer to help them destroy our own missiles. there is even the george c. scott/ walter matthau general who argues that their \\\"nucular\\\" armory can't match ours so we should hit them with everything we've got. more fireballs. <br /><br />the end comes none too soon.\",\n          \"in sri lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-sinhalese government and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), a separatist organization, has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983. human rights groups have said that, as a result of the war, more than one million people have been displaced, homeless or living in camps. the impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed tamil director mani ratnam in his 2002 film a peck on the cheek, winner of several awards at the national film awards in india. while the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery, the human cost of war is made quite clear and ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.<br /><br />beautifully photographed in southern india by cinematographer ravi k chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of sri lanka, the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in sri lanka. played with deep feeling and expressiveness by p.s. keerthana in a memorable performance, amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents shyama (nandita das) and dileepan (j.d. chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a red cross camp. in a loving flashback, we see amudha's adoptive parents, father thiru (madhavan) a prominent tamil writer, and mother indra (simran) a tv personality, marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.<br /><br />young amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday, according to the parents' prior agreement. while she is playing, thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that \\\"you are not our daughter\\\" and the response is predictable. distraught, she questions who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she gave her up, and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to sri lanka to help her find her true mother, now a fighter for the tamil separatists. the family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, handled mostly with skill by ratnam, though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.<br /><br />a peck on the cheek is of course a bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. the melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however, i found the musical dramatizations of songs by a. r. rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick, high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as being too clich\\u00e9d and commercial, yet a peck on the cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. that it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.\",\n          \"futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s (the origins of off off broadway). though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution. the story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. on the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in america.<br /><br />the stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the u.s. and europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it. luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, tom o'horgan (who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway).<br /><br />this is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget. and it just might change the way you see the world...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

objective it is one in the set of lies pushed by milosevic regime everyone else is guilty only serbians were right and victims even though most of the war criminals tried in hague are serbs even though serbs are one who have committed genocide against bosnians  and attacked slovenia croatiaand bosnia all independent nations recognized by the unbreakup of yugoslavia was not avoidable because serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on federal yugoslav government so slovenia croatia macedonia and bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interestsif you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of yugoslavia and fact led documentary this is not it  you should watch yugoslaviadeath of a nation made by discovery channel and bbc\",\n          \"beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature forbidden lie2007 is simply a better cinematic version of norma khouris book forbidden love and that was a bestseller an onionpeeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman lie is the very best in editorialised reality tvcleverly edited and colourful broinowskis storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke i disagree with variety that its overlong instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others justrecorded testimonials on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes miredso i watched it twicethis oscarworthy effort is at once genuinely funny upsetting and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouris friends and fans clearly these friends are now turned the funniest oncamera line belonging to khouris qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat nononsense colloquialisms i think its a load of sht personallywe need to learn from their experience hence my belief in spoilers any perennial liespinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie theres some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian who instead presses her conartist repeatedly for corroborationsince being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication khouri has been on the run but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name she absconded supposedly because a shes either terrified of her sly moreitaliansoundingthangreek husband or b because she needed her passportvisas to clear her name unlikelya more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas one guess no not jordan according to a closing card khouri is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge instead the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen once they caught on there was plenty counterderision and catcalls earlier stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didnt know how to take khouris evolving contradictionsthe filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end not leaving anything outnot even her own selfsacrificeanna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at firstkey to how a lifelong liar operates in halftruths khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yrold with rather disarming charm and surprisingly workedout bicepsgradually were introduced to lessandlessadulating aussie journos publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouris honourkilling accusations hook line and sinker later we see their more rueful reactions quite selfcontrolled and matteroffact if some perhaps a little bitterit was jordanian antihonourkilling activists who took deepest umbrage at khouris fallacies because its potstirring forced them to reduce the pace of change honourkillings do happen in jordan its just their prevalence thats at odds with khouris bookplus 72 other facts in 2003 these activists faxed australian random house with 73 painstakinglychecked objectionsthe publishing houses across 4 continents whod jumped at the chance to publish firsttime author khouri never tried to check any facts leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract they too were fair game so a massive hottopic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafeslater still were shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to khouris bio as well for one thing shes not only not a 35yrold virgin her defence is that she merely didnt disabuse people of their assumptions but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers sometimes shes just too fasttalking in her american accent she also seems toocomfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who dont need any western paternalism from me but when even cultural cues dont jibe in addition to khouris facts youve got to start questioning your sourceat some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account in person in jordan the last third is consumed with a factfinding trip back to amman where one fact after another falls eventually broinowski forces her conartist to admit the decadediscrepancy in her story and its after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera secret because in it khouris american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent hes an actor we never find out how anna uncovered it so this becomes the filmmakers triumph as she never flags in her tone or commitment her oncamera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt fbi documentsand khouris most shocking initial crimeanna broinowski watchlist her now is even clever enough to use the one artistic device key players crosscommenting on footage to kill two birdsmaking her audiences want to drink from the same well againin fact despite her deceptively demure approach she made me reconfirm that overington and knox really did win their 2004 walkleys in investigate journalism for their norma khouri investigationbroinowski made me look1010\",\n          \"dear reader watch out this movie is not really a movie though its creators have the impertinence to call it so if you have not been warned about its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack its purpose being to create atmosphere as well however the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of civilized warfare it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos but also because it is far too long and tiresome and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with war in whichever conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed
